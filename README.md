# FarmBot Software for the RaspBerry Pi

This software is responsible for receiving the commands from the 'farmbot cloud backend', execute them and report back the results.

Technical Stuff
---------------

![Diagram](diagram1.png)
[Thanks, SketchBoard.me](https://sketchboard.me/RzvYVFEQuREe#/)

* Written in Ruby.
* Operation scheduling data is stored in SQLite 3.
* Device status info, such as X, Y, Z and calibration data is stored via [PStore](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.2/libdoc/pstore/rdoc/PStore.html)
* Messaging happens via [MeshBlu](https://github.com/octoblu/meshblu) (machine instant messaging)
* Communicates with Arduino hardware using the [farmbot-serial gem](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-serial)

# Running in production

```
bundle install
```

If you want to enable auto restarts on crash or memory leak, run:

```
god -c farmbot.god -D
```

If you don't care about autorestarts, just run:

```
ruby farmbot.rb
```

**You can find your device credentials inside of `credentials.yml`**

# Running on Local

If you're running your own local [farmbot web app](https://github.com/farmbot/farmbot-web-app)

`FBENV=development ruby farmbot.rb`


Installation
============

Install Ruby 2.2
----------------

This gem requires Ruby 2.2. As of this writing, a Pi is loaded with 1.9.3 by default.

To upgrade your ruby version, try this:

```
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

This will take about 2 hours on a standard pi.

Raspberry PI
------------

Update the RPi, install ruby and the arduino IDE
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core sqlite3 arduino bundler
```

Clone, install and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-raspberry-pi-controller
cd farmbot-raspberry-pi-controller
bundle install
rake db:setup
ruby farmbot.rb
```

At this point, your MeshBlu credentials can be found in `credentials.yml`

Arduino
-------

**If your device doesn't use `/dev/ttyACM0`**: Write the name of your serial device (usually /dev/ttyUSB0) in `serial_port.txt`.

You will need to flash your Arduino with custom firmware. For instructions on how to do this, see [the FarmBot-Arduino github page](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-serial)
